Create a complete full-stack e-commerce web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

### Requirements & Features

#### 🏗 Architecture & Structure
- Use a clean folder structure:
  /client (React frontend)
  /server (Node/Express backend)
  /server/controllers
  /server/models
  /server/routes
  /server/middleware
  /client/src/components
  /client/src/pages
  /client/src/context
  /client/src/hooks

#### 📦 Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)
- Create REST API endpoints for:
  /auth - register, login, logout (JWT)
  /products - get all products, get single product, create, update, delete
  /cart - manage user cart items
  /orders - place and fetch orders
- Use MongoDB models for User, Product, Cart, Order.
- Password hashing using bcrypt.
- Authentication using JWT & httpOnly cookies.
- Admin middleware: only admins can create/edit/delete products.
- Seed the database with example demo products on startup.

#### 🎨 Frontend (React + Vite + TailwindCSS)
- Use React Router for navigation.
- Pages:
  Home page (featured products and hero section)
  Products page (product grid, search, filter by category)
  Product detail page (title, price, description, images, ratings, add to cart)
  Cart page (update quantities, remove items, checkout)
  Checkout page with order summary
  Login and Signup pages with auth validation
  Admin Dashboard (add/edit/delete products form)
  User Profile & Order history page
- Components:
  Navbar, Footer, ProductCard, Button, Loader, Modal, Alert, ProtectedRoute
- Use React Context or Redux Toolkit for global state: user + cart
- Responsive UI using TailwindCSS
- Add smooth animations using Framer Motion

#### 🛒 Shopping Cart & Checkout
- Users can add products to cart
- Cart updates in real time
- Stores cart in database for logged users and localStorage for guests
- Checkout page that calculates total price and places order

#### 🛠 Admin Panel
- Only admin users can access the admin pages
- Admin features:
  Create new product (image, name, price, stock, category, description)
  Update product
  Delete product
  View list of orders

#### 🚀 Additional Requirements
- Include example demo products data automatically inserted in database
- Write clear comments explaining each important part
- Use environment variables (.env)
- Include README.md with installation and run instructions
- Connect backend and frontend with proxy configuration
- Deploy-ready structure

#### 🧪 Optional Enhancements (if possible)
- Product rating/review system
- Image upload support (Cloudinary)
- Payment simulation section

### Deliverables
- Fully working MERN application with auth and admin features
- Clean UI, responsive layout, polished look
- Source code ready to run on Replit or local machine
